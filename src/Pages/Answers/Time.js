          <li>Time is measured using a clock.</li>
          <li>

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Some clocks have a third hand called the second hand.</li>
          <li>
            In 1 hour, the hour hand moves from one number to the next number on
            the clock.
          </li>
          <li>
            In 1 hour, the minute hand goes once around the clock and comes back
            to its starting position.
          </li>
          <li>
            When the hour hand is at 3 and the minute hand is at 12, the time is
            read as 3 o' clock or 3:
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ol start="0">
          <li></li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
          <li>We use 2 dots (:) to separate hours and minutes.</li>
          <li>
            24 hours of a day are divided into day (12 hours) and night (12
            hours).
          </li>
          <li>
            The time between 12 o' clock in the midnight and 12 o' clock in the
            day is called forenoon (Morning).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The time between 12 o' clock in the day and 12 o' clock in the night
          is &amp; called afternoon. (At 12 o' clock it is noon.)
        </p>
