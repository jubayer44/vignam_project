<p><strong>LEARNING OBJECTIVES</strong></p>
<p>This lesson will help you to:â€”</p>
<ul>
<li>identify 2-Dimensional (2-D) shapes.</li>
<li>study the properties of 2-D shapes.</li>
<li>identify some of the 3-D shapes.</li>
<li>distinguish between straight and curved lines.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>QUICK CONCEPT REVIEW</strong></p>
<p><strong>SHAPES</strong></p>
<p>When we look around, we find objects of different shapes. Some objects you also carry in your school bags. For example: pencil, pen lunch box, ruler etc.</p>
<p><strong>Do you know their shapes?</strong></p>
<p>Let us discuss some of these shapes in detail.</p>
<ol>
<li>You all must have played LUDO with your friends. Do you know shape of its dice?</li>
</ol>
<p>Dice is having shape of a cube.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Match box, that we use for lighting fire has a shape of a cuboid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cold drink cans have shape of a cylinder.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ice-cream cones are having shape of a cone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Football has a shape of a sphere.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The shapes we have discussed above are 3-Dimensional shapes. These are also known as solid shapes. Flat shapes like circle, triangle, square and rectangle are also called 2 - Dimensional shapes. Now, observe how we can make 2-D (2-Dimensional) shapes from 3-D (3-Dimensional) shapes by simply using pencil. Whichever shapes you want to draw, put it on the paper and draw its lower bottom. The shapes thus formed are 2-D (2-Dimensional) shapes.</p>
<p><strong>Rectangle</strong></p>
<p>A Rectangle has four sides. Two opposite sides are equal and all the four angles are also equal.</p>
<p><strong>Square</strong></p>
<p>A Square has four sides. All the sides are equal Four angles are also equal.</p>
<p><strong>Triangle</strong></p>
<p>It has sides and three and angles. Sides and angles can be different or equal.</p>
<p><strong>Circle</strong></p>
<p>It has no sides and it is round in shape.</p>
<p><strong>LINES</strong></p>
<p>When we move a pencil along one of the edges of a scale we get a LINE.</p>
<p><strong>1. Straight Line</strong></p>
<p>If you stretch a thread tightly, you get a straight line squares, rectangles and triangles are made of straight lines.</p>
<p><strong>Horizontal, Vertical and Slanting lines</strong></p>
<p>Look at door of your classroom. Along the floor, we see a line. It is called horizontal or sleeping line. The lines along the wall are vertical lines.</p>
<p>The lines that are neither vertical nor horizontal are called slanting lines.</p>
<p>We can draw a slanted line by placing a ruler on the paper.</p>
<p>*<em>2. Curved line</em></p>
<p>The curved line is drawn without the use of a ruler. It is not a straight line. If you hold the thread loosely, you get a curved line.</p>
<p><strong>Examples of curved lines</strong></p>
<p>Circles and ovals are made curved lines.</p>
<p><strong>ANGLE</strong></p>
<p>An angle is formed by joining two lines.</p>
<p><strong>Amazing Fact</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Squircle is a type of shape which is essentially a combination of a circle and a square having properties of a both, Lately, Squircles have found widespread use in modern car designs.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Real Life Examples</strong></p>
<p>We can find a lot of example of solid shapes in our surroundings.</p>
<p><strong>For example</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Coins are circular in shape and books that we read are cuboid in shape.</li>
<li>The bricks that are used for making houses are cuboid in shape, the ball with which we play is a sphere.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Historical preview</strong></p>
<p>The invention of a wheel (a circle shape) was one of the most important inventions in human history.</p></div>
