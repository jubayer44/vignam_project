<p>When the minute hand is at <strong>12</strong> then the actual time is the number that is indicated by the shorter or hour hand. For example, just see the following:</p>

<p>Here the longer or the minute hand is at 12 and hour or shorter hand indicates 9. Therefore, the time is 9 or 9 O ' clock. Similarly, in the clock shown below. The time is 4 or 4 O'clock.</p>

<p>When the minute hand is at any number we do counting in 5 like.</p>
<p>5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45 and 50</p>
<p>If minute hand is at <strong>1</strong> it shows <strong>5</strong> minutes.</p>

<p>If minute hand is at <strong>2</strong> it shows <strong>10</strong> minutes.</p>

<p>If minute hand is at <strong>3</strong> it shows <strong>15</strong> minutes.</p>

<p>And this process goes on Let's look at the picture given below:</p>
<p><img src="https://vignam-content-images.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/2023-01-05T11%3A51%3A57.203Z.png" alt=""/></p>
<p>Here the shorter or hour hand stays between <strong>1</strong> &amp; <strong>2</strong> while minute hand indicates <strong>4</strong>. So the time is 01 : 20 . When we do counting in <strong>5</strong> for <strong>4</strong> it goes as 5,10,15 and 20.</p>
<p>Thus the longer hand indicates <strong>20</strong> minutes.</p>
<p>It does mean the actual time is 1: 20 and we read it as 20 minutes past 1.</p>
<p>Similarly if shorter or hour hand is somewhere between <strong>2</strong> &amp; <strong>3</strong> and minute hand is at 5 then the time is 2:25 and it will be read as '25' minutes past 2.</p>

<p>When the longer or minute hand is at <strong>6</strong>, the time is read as the half past the hour.</p>
<p>Let's see the picture given below:</p>
<p><img src="https://vignam-content-images.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/2023-01-05T11%3A52%3A39.793Z.png" alt=""/></p>
<p>Here the hour or shorter hand is somewhere between <strong>1</strong> &amp; <strong>2</strong> and minute hand is at <strong>6</strong>. Therefore, the time is 1: 30 and it is read as 'half past 1'</p>
<p>Similarly if the hour hand is somewhere between <strong>4</strong> &amp; <strong>5</strong> and minute hand is at <strong>6</strong> then the actual time is 4 : 30 and it is read as 'half past 4'</p></div>
        </div>
