            <p>When we talk about nouns, we can also talk about the number of nouns. Nouns can be either singular or plural. A singular noun is a noun that refers to only one person, place, thing, or idea. It is important to understand the concept of singular nouns as it helps to improve our language skills and make our communication more effective and efficient.</p> <br /><br />

            <p>
            A singular noun is a word that is used to name one person, place, thing, or idea. For example, "mango," "queen," "bulb," and "dog" are all examples of singular nouns. Each of these words names one specific item or person. A singular noun is used when we are talking about only one of something. For example, "I have one mango in my hand." Here we are talking about only one mango, so we use the singular noun "mango."

            It's important to know when to use singular nouns in a sentence as it affects the verb tense and agreement in a sentence. Singular nouns are also different from plural nouns, where plural nouns refer to more than one person, place, thing, or idea.
