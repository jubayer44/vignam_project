<p>Money in India is counted in terms of paise and rupees.</p>

<p><strong>Identifying Coins</strong></p>
<p>All coins are made up of metal. In India, at present coins of 50 paise, Rs.  1, Rs. 2, Rs. 5 and Rs. 10 are in circulation.</p>
<pre><code>       Example:
</code></pre>
<p>Just see the 50 paise and Rs. 2 coins given below:</p>

<p>From the pictures given above, it is clear that the denominations of coins are written on them. When we see a coin, we find the denomination given on it. It helps us to understand the value of the coin easily.</p>
<p><strong>Identifying Notes</strong></p>
<p>The information that is required to identify the rupees are written on a paper and is called 'Note'. In India, Rs. 5, Rs. 10, Rs. 20, Rs. Rs. 50, Rs. 100, Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes are in circulation.</p>
<pre><code>     Example:
</code></pre>
<p>Look at the Rs.10 and Rs. 20 notes given herewith:</p>
<p><img src="https://vignam-content-images.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/2023-01-06T09%3A10%3A46.973Z.png" alt=""/></p>
<p><strong>Adding Cost of Things</strong></p>
<p>This is the grouping of the costs of two or more things and converting them into single money value.</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<p>If cost of one apple =Rs.[2]</p>
<p>and cost of one banana=Rs.[4]</p>
<p>and cost of one orange =Rs.[6]</p>
<p>The total cost of all the three fruits, therefore, is:</p>
<p>cost of one apple + cost of one banana + cost of one orange =Rs.[2]+Rs. [ 4 ] +Rs. [ 8 ] .</p>
