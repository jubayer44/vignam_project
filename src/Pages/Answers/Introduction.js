            <p>In English, we use different tenses to express when an action is happening. One of the tenses is the present tense, which is used to describe actions that are happening now. This concept is important for class 1 students to understand as it allows them to effectively communicate what is happening currently.</p>

            <h3 className='text-2xl font-bold my-2'>Present Tense</h3>
            <p>The present tense is used to describe actions that are happening currently or are generally true. The present tense is formed by using the base form of the verb, for example, "I walk" or "She plays". There are also different forms of the present tense such as the present continuous or present progressive, which is used to describe actions that are happening now, such as "I am walking" or "She is playing".</p>

            <h3 className='text-2xl font-bold my-2'>Using Present Tense</h3>
            <p>It is important to use the present tense correctly in order to make our sentences grammatically correct and to effectively express what is happening now. Here are some examples:</p>
            <ul className='list-disc ml-14'>
                <li>The sun shines brightly.</li>
                <li>I eat breakfast every day.</li>
                <li>The cat sleeps on the bed.</li>
                <li>He works hard.</li>
                <li>They study at the library.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className='my-4'>It's important to practice using the present tense in different forms and context to be able to use it fluently in your sentences. Also, it's good to practice identifying the present tense in sentences and understand the context of the conversation.</p>
            <p>Overall, understanding and using the present tense correctly will help you to communicate effectively and describe what is happening now.</p>
