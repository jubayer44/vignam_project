          Time and Calendar

        <p>
          <strong>Concept of Time</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          A day is divided into hours. An hour is divided into minutes and a
          minute is divided into seconds. See the following examples:
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, Leesa reaches school on 8 O'clock every day. Here 8
          O'clock is the time
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Hours, Minutes and Seconds</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Hours, minutes and seconds are units for the measurement of time.</p>
        <p>For example, we can say</p>
        <p>2 hours; 2 minutes; 2 seconds.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Now just remember:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>24 hours = 1 day</p>
        <p>1 hour = 60 minutes</p>
        <p>1 minute = 60 seconds</p>
        <p>Hence 1 day = 24 hours</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Knowing Time</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Knowing time means knowing period or duration of a certain event.</p>
        <p>For example,</p>
        <p>
          A man goes to a certain distance in 60 minutes. We can therefore say
          that he takes 1 hour to cover the certain distance.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Time Indicating Watches</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Let's see the face of a clock given below:</p>
        <p>
          <img
            src="https://vignam-content-images.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/2023-01-05T11%3A47%3A34.511Z.png"
            alt=""
          />
        </p>
        <p>
          Look carefully at the clock given. It has two hands. One is the
          shorter hand, which is called hour hand. The other is the longer hand,
          which is called minute hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Important Points</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          The hour hand moves from one number to the next in 1 hour. The hour
          hand takes two complete rounds in a day. The minute hand takes 1 hour
          to complete one round.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Reading Time from a Clock</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Trick 1</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          When the minute hand is at 12 then the actual time is the number that
          is indicated by the shorter or hour hand. For example, just see the
          following:
        </p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>
          <img
            src="https://vignam-content-images.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/2023-01-05T11%3A47%3A52.487Z.png"
            alt=""
          />
        </p>
        <p>
          Here the longer or the minute hand is at 12 and hour or shorter hand
          indicates 9.
        </p>
        <p>Therefore, the time is 9 or 9 0 ' clock.</p>
        <p>Similarly, in the clock shown below. The time is 4 or 4 O'clock.</p>
        <p>
          <img
            src="https://vignam-content-images.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/2023-01-05T11%3A48%3A08.590Z.png"
            alt=""
          />
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Trick 2</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Counting of the movements of minute hand at each of the number
          starting from 1 to 12 is done in the unit of 5, as given below:
        </p>
        <p>5, 10 , 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55 and 60</p>
        <p>
          If shorter or hour hand is somewhere between 2 and 1 and minute hand
          is at 5 then the time is 2 : 25 and it will be read as ‘25’ minutes
          past 2.
        </p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>
          <img
            src="https://vignam-content-images.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/2023-01-05T11%3A48%3A28.096Z.png"
            alt=""
          />
        </p>
        <p>The above clock shows the time ten past five that is 10:05.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Calendar</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          A calendar is a system of organizing various periods of time. This is
          done by giving names to the periods as days, weeks, months and year.
        </p>
        <p>

          <strong>Week</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          A period of seven days is called a week. In other words there are
          seven days in a week. They are as follows:
        </p>
        <p>Day : Description</p>

        <p>Thursday :Thursday is called the fourth day of the week.</p>
        <p>Friday : Friday is called the fifth day of the week.</p>
        <p>Saturday : Saturday is called the sixth day of the week.</p>
        <p>Sunday : Sunday is called the seventh day of the week.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Months in a Year</strong>
        </p>
        <p>There are 12 months in a year. They are as follows:</p>
        <p>Months/Number of Days : Description</p>
        <p>1.January/31 : It is the first month of the year.</p>
        <p>2.February/(28/29) : It is the second month of the year</p>
